Follow these steps to start tracking your coding time in OnShape with Hackatime.

## Step 1: Log into Hackatime

Make sure you have a [Hackatime account](https://hackatime.hackclub.com) and are logged in.

## Step 2: Get Your API key

Visit the [setup page](https://hackatime.hackclub.com/my/wakatime_setup#show-advanced-button), press on the button called "Custom Setup" and copy the api key. 

It should be random letters and numbers with some dashes in between. EX: 1234abcd-56ef-7891-abcd-efgh2345abcd

## Step 3: Install the Wakatime for OnShape Extension

Install the extension from [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/onshape-wakatime/kieglbolocchhhcblnhaiodbpgkjcecg) or from the [FireFox Addons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/onshape-wakatime/). (PS: If you like it, pls rate it!)


## Step 4: Config Your OnShape Extension

Visit [OnShape](https://onshape.com/) and login. Go to any of your documents and press on the Wakatime for Onshape extension icon to open its config page. 

In the WAKA api key section, paste your api key from Step 2 and make sure tracking is enabled (You should see some green on the switch). Do not change the API url. 

## Troubleshooting

- **Not seeing your time?** Make sure you have completed all the steps above and set the correct api key
- **Plugin not working?** Try refreshing OnShape after installation
- **Still stuck?** Ask for help in by pinging @Jeffrey Wang on [Hack Club Slack](https://hackclub.slack.com) (#hackatime-v2 channel)
