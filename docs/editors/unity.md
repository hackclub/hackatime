# How to Track Time in Unity

![Unity](/images/editor-icons/unity-128.png)

Let's set up Unity to count how much time you spend making games!

## Step 1: Make a Hackatime Account

Go to [Hackatime](https://hackatime.hackclub.com) and make an account. Then log in.

## Step 2: Get Your Settings Ready

Click this link to the [setup page](https://hackatime.hackclub.com/my/wakatime_setup). It will set up your account so it works with Unity.

## Step 3: Add the Plugin to Unity

There are a few different Unity plugins. Here's the easiest one:

1. Open Unity Hub and start a project
2. Go to this GitHub page: [Unity WakaTime Plugin](https://github.com/bengsfort/WakaTime-Unity)
3. Click the green **Code** button, then **Download ZIP**
4. Unzip the file you downloaded
5. In Unity, go to **Assets** → **Import Package** → **Custom Package**
6. Find the unzipped folder and select the `.unitypackage` file
7. Click **Import** on everything

After installing, the plugin will use your settings from Step 2.

## If Something Goes Wrong

**Can't see your time?** Go back to the [setup page](https://hackatime.hackclub.com/my/wakatime_setup) and try again.

**Plugin not working?** Close Unity and open it again.

**Package Manager not working?** Make sure you're connected to the internet.

**Still having trouble?** Ask for help in [Hack Club Slack](https://hackclub.slack.com) - look for the #hackatime-dev channel.

## What Happens Next

Start making your game! Your time will show up on your [Hackatime page](https://hackatime.hackclub.com) in a few minutes.
