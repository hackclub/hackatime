# How to Track Time in Cursor

![Cursor](/images/editor-icons/cursor-128.png)

Let's set up Cursor (the AI code editor) to count how much time you spend coding!

## Step 1: Make a Hackatime Account

Go to [Hackatime](https://hackatime.hackclub.com) and make an account. Then log in.

## Step 2: Get Your Settings Ready

Click this link to the [setup page](https://hackatime.hackclub.com/my/wakatime_setup). It will set up your account so it works with Cursor.

## Step 3: Add the Plugin to Cursor

1. Open Cursor
2. Click the squares icon on the left (Extensions)
3. Type "WakaTime" in the search box
4. Click the **Install** button next to WakaTime
5. Cursor might ask you to restart - click **Reload** if it does

That's it! The plugin will use your settings from Step 2.

## If Something Goes Wrong

**Can't see your time?** Go back to the [setup page](https://hackatime.hackclub.com/my/wakatime_setup) and try again.

**Plugin not working?** Close Cursor and open it again.

**Still having trouble?** Ask for help in [Hack Club Slack](https://hackclub.slack.com) - look for the #hackatime-dev channel.

## What Happens Next

Start coding with AI help! Your time will show up on your [Hackatime page](https://hackatime.hackclub.com) in a few minutes.
