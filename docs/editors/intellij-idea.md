# How to Track Time in IntelliJ IDEA

![IntelliJ IDEA](/images/editor-icons/intellij-idea-128.png)

Let's set up IntelliJ IDEA to count how much time you spend coding in Java!

## Step 1: Make a Hackatime Account

Go to [Hackatime](https://hackatime.hackclub.com) and make an account. Then log in.

## Step 2: Get Your Settings Ready

Click this link to the [setup page](https://hackatime.hackclub.com/my/wakatime_setup). It will set up your account so it works with IntelliJ IDEA.

## Step 3: Add the Plugin to IntelliJ IDEA

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA
2. Go to **File** → **Settings** (on Mac: **IntelliJ IDEA** → **Preferences**)
3. Click **Plugins** on the left
4. Click the **Marketplace** tab at the top
5. Type "WakaTime" in the search box
6. Click **Install** next to WakaTime
7. Click **Restart IDE** when it asks

That's it! The plugin will use your settings from Step 2.

## If Something Goes Wrong

**Can't see your time?** Go back to the [setup page](https://hackatime.hackclub.com/my/wakatime_setup) and try again.

**Plugin not working?** Close IntelliJ IDEA and open it again.

**Still having trouble?** Ask for help in [Hack Club Slack](https://hackclub.slack.com) - look for the #hackatime-dev channel.

## What Happens Next

Start coding! Your time will show up on your [Hackatime page](https://hackatime.hackclub.com) in a few minutes.
