Follow these steps to start tracking your coding time in Swift Playgrounds or any other iPad apps with Hackatime.

_P.S.: If you're tracking any apps that do not save their files to the Files app (e.g. Procreate), this will not work!_
_If you're going to be using Codespaces on your iPad, please switch to the guide on Codespaces, available at the [setup page](https://hackatime.hackclub.com/my/wakatime_setup)_

## Step 1: Log into Hackatime

Make sure you have a [Hackatime account](https://hackatime.hackclub.com) and are logged in.

## Step 2: Download the App and set it up 

Start by downloading it from the [TestFlight Link](https://testflight.apple.com/join/xCpuSbPs). You will need to download the [TestFlight App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/testflight/id899247664) before you use the link to get it.

Visit the [setup page](https://hackatime.hackclub.com/my/wakatime_setup) and copy the `api_key`, `api_url` and `heartbeat_rate_limit_seconds`. This ensures everything works perfectly with Hackatime.

## Step 3: Select your project/folder
Hit the "Select folder" button in the middle and enter the directory you're working in and hit the "Done" in the top right or click on the Swift Playgrounds project if you're working on one. 

## Step 4: Click start to start tracking!

The app will request for your permission to work in the background. We ask this so we can run the app in the background, as Apple has some infamously strict regulations on iPad and iPhone apps.

After a while of coding, you should see a heartbeat be passed through, and it will even show a `DEBUG: 202 Request Received` message in the console!

## Troubleshooting

- **Not seeing your time?** Make sure you completed the [setup page](https://hackatime.hackclub.com/my/wakatime_setup) first
- **Plugin not working?** Try restarting Wakatime Playgrounds. If the app crashes on you, please contact [@advaitconty on the Hack Club Slack](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U0794TACKMG)
- **Still stuck?** Ask for help from [@advaitconty on Hack Club Slack](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U0794TACKMG) (DMs)

## Next Steps

Once configured, your coding time will automatically appear on your [Hackatime dashboard](https://hackatime.hackclub.com). Happy coding!
