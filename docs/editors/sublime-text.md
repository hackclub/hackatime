# How to Track Time in Sublime Text

![Sublime Text](/images/editor-icons/sublime-text-128.png)

Let's set up Sublime Text to count how much time you spend coding!

## Step 1: Make a Hackatime Account

Go to [Hackatime](https://hackatime.hackclub.com) and make an account. Then log in.

## Step 2: Get Your Settings Ready

Click this link to the [setup page](https://hackatime.hackclub.com/my/wakatime_setup). It will set up your account so it works with Sublime Text.

## Step 3: Add the Plugin to Sublime Text

1. Open Sublime Text
2. Go to **Tools** â†’ **Command Palette** (or press **Ctrl+Shift+P** on Windows, **Cmd+Shift+P** on Mac)
3. Type "install" and choose **Package Control: Install Package**
4. Wait a moment, then type "WakaTime"
5. Click on **WakaTime** to install it
6. It will ask for your API key - just press Enter (it uses your settings from Step 2)

That's it! The plugin will use your settings from Step 2.

## If Something Goes Wrong

**Can't see your time?** Go back to the [setup page](https://hackatime.hackclub.com/my/wakatime_setup) and try again.

**Plugin not working?** Close Sublime Text and open it again.

**Don't have Package Control?** Go to [packagecontrol.io](https://packagecontrol.io/installation) to install it first.

**Still having trouble?** Ask for help in [Hack Club Slack](https://hackclub.slack.com) - look for the #hackatime-dev channel.

## What Happens Next

Start coding! Your time will show up on your [Hackatime page](https://hackatime.hackclub.com) in a few minutes.
