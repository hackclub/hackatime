# Advanced Setup Stuff

Want to make Hackatime work better for you? Here are some extra things you can set up.

## Connect Your GitHub Projects

Link your coding projects to GitHub so they show up better on leaderboards:

1. First, authenticate with GitHub by going to [Projects](https://hackatime.hackclub.com/my/projects) and clicking "Sign in with GitHub"
2. This will automatically link your GitHub projects to your coding activity
3. If you need to override a project link, go to [Projects](https://hackatime.hackclub.com/my/projects) → click the pencil emoji (✏️) next to a project → set the GitHub URL

This helps because:
* Your projects show up with links on leaderboards
* Other people can see what you're building
* Your GitHub activity connects to your coding time

## Set Your Time Zone

Make sure your daily stats are right by setting your time zone:

1. Go to [Settings](https://hackatime.hackclub.com/my/settings)
2. Pick your time zone from the list
3. Save it

## What We Track (And What We Don't)

### What Hackatime Sees

Hackatime only tracks:
* **File names** (like `main.py` or `index.html`)
* **What language you're coding in** (like Python or JavaScript)
* **What editor you use** (like VS Code or Vim)
* **How long you code**

### What Hackatime Never Sees

Hackatime **never** tracks:
* What you type in your code
* Your passwords
* Screenshots of your screen
* Anything you type on your keyboard

## Hide Files You Don't Want Tracked

You can tell WakaTime to ignore certain files. Make a file called `.wakatime-project` in your project folder:

```
[settings]
exclude = 
    /node_modules/
    /vendor/
    *.log
    /temp/
```

This will ignore:
* `node_modules` and `vendor` folders
* Any `.log` files
* The `temp` folder

## Only Track Certain Projects

If you only want to track projects that have a `.wakatime-project` file:

```
[settings]
include_only_with_project_file = true
```
