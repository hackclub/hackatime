# Add Plugins to Your Editor

Here's how to add WakaTime plugins to your code editor so Hackatime can track your coding time.

## What You Need

Before you start, make sure you have:

- A code editor (like VS Code, PyCharm, Vim, etc.)
- A [Hackatime account](/)

## Step 1: Do the Automated Setup

**First, use our automated [setup tutorial](https://hackatime.hackclub.com/my/wakatime_setup)!** It automatically sets up your API key and endpoint so everything works perfectly.

## Step 2: Add WakaTime Plugin

After doing the automated setup, install the WakaTime plugin for your editor. Visit our [editor documentation](https://hackatime.hackclub.com/docs#supported-editors) for instructions on how to install a WakaTime plugin for your specific editor.

## Already Have the Plugin Installed?

If you already have a WakaTime plugin, just run the [setup page](https://hackatime.hackclub.com/my/wakatime_setup) to switch it to Hackatime. It will automatically update your settings.

## Check If It's Working

After setup, start coding! Your time will show up on your [Hackatime dashboard](https://hackatime.hackclub.com) in a few minutes.

## Need Help?

- **Not seeing your time?** Make sure the API URL is set correctly
- **Plugin not working?** Try closing and opening your editor again
