# Hackatime Quick Start Guide - Free WakaTime Alternative

Get up and running with Hackatime in under 5 minutes! Start tracking your coding time across 40+ editors with our free, open source WakaTime alternative.

## What is Hackatime?

**Hackatime** is a **free and open source** alternative to WakaTime that automatically tracks your coding time across all your favorite editors and IDEs. It works with **every existing WakaTime editor plugin** by simply configuring your `~/.wakatime.cfg` file to point to Hackatime's servers instead of WakaTime's.

## Step 1: Create Your Account

Visit [hackatime.hackclub.com](https://hackatime.hackclub.com) and sign up using:
- Your Hack Club Slack account (recommended)
- Email address

## Step 2: Run Automated Setup

üöÄ **Visit the [Hackatime Setup Page](https://hackatime.hackclub.com/my/wakatime_setup)** - this will:

1. Auto-detect your operating system
2. Provide a copy-paste command that configures everything
3. Create your `~/.wakatime.cfg` file pointing to Hackatime
4. Send a test heartbeat to verify setup
5. Show you when it's working!

The setup page handles all configuration automatically - no manual editing required!

## Step 3: Install WakaTime Plugin
